## Data Notes

- **History:** Since inception for each ETF (max available from Yahoo Finance).
- **Benchmark:** SPY for all models.
- **Risk-free rate:** 13-week T-bill (^IRX), falling back to 5.25%.
- **Cache TTL:** 1 hour — data refreshes automatically on a new session.
- **Fama-French factors:** Fetched from Kenneth French's public data library via `pandas-datareader`. Requires internet access. If unavailable, model 2 shows a graceful fallback message.
- **NAV data:** Only available for ETFs where Yahoo Finance exposes `navPrice`. Many ETFs will show N/A.

### Insufficient Data
ETFs with fewer than 252 trading days of history display:
> *"ETF does not have enough history to complete analysis."*

This is expected for newer ETFs such as CEPI, CHPY, SYPI, DTCR, TSPY, XQQI, IAUI.

## Pages

- **Overview:** All 10 model charts side-by-side with plain-English interpretations.
- **ETF Detail:** Select any ETF from the sidebar to see a dedicated page with key metrics, price history vs SPY, and all model results for that ETF.
